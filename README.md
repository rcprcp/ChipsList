# ChipsList
ChipsList is a grocery list program. 

Worked with lots of SQLite database features - referential integrity, ORDER BY clause, JOINs.
Worked with lots of Activities to organize the code. 
Subclasses the BaseListAdapter to implement SectionIndexer to handle a large list of items in real time.

Example Android program, works well enough, but has some rough edges - 
TODO: 
* needs to have the database code replaced or augmented with JPA/Hibernate.
* it would be nide to snazz-up the UI with better animations.  
* fragment support to look better on a tablet.
